# Installing Dependencies

## Install Java
Make sure your terminal is running **Java 1.8**
To check:
    Run `javac -v`
See [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21964709/how-to-set-or-change-the-default-java-jdk-version-on-os-x/30875847) for how to change this on macOS
Note that if you use a different Java version (i.e., v11), you will get obscure `pom.xml` errors that have nothing to do with the Java version.

<<insert instructions for windows>> @dan how did you do this on windows?

## Install Maven

### macOS
Run `brew install maven` if you have Homebrew installed
Check you’re around version 3.6.1 by running `mvn -v`.
### Windows
Follow the instructions on the [maven website](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
Check you’re around version 3.6.1 by running `mvn -v`.

# Running the Project

After `cd`-ing into the root project directory, run
```shell
mvn compile:exec java
```
This will compile and run the server locally on port `4567`.
To access it, go to `localhost:4567` in your browser.

# Specific Changes to Our Program

For the first launch of the program, *before* going to the home screen, if the user attempts to access the following pages, they should be redirected to the home screen:
/game
/signin

As a note, we also fell behind on sprint 2 cards -- many are partially complete. This is why the acceptance test plan has a lot of greyed out squares!
